# Configuration: /github-merge-flow-net10.jsonc
#
# Key features (from arcade):
#   - Event-driven: triggers on push, with daily cron safety net
#   - ResetToTargetPaths: auto-resets version files to target branch versions
#   - QuietComments: reduces GitHub notification noise
#   - Skips PRs when only Maestro bot commits exist
#   - Updates existing open PR instead of creating new ones
