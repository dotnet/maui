# Evaluate PR Tests

Invoke the **evaluate-pr-tests** skill: read and follow `.github/skills/evaluate-pr-tests/SKILL.md`.

## Context

- **Repository**: ${{ github.repository }}
- **PR Number**: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.event.issue.number || inputs.pr_number }}

The PR branch has been checked out for you. All files from the PR are available locally.

## Pre-flight check

Before starting, verify the skill file exists:

```bash
test -f .github/skills/evaluate-pr-tests/SKILL.md
```

If the file is **missing**, the fork PR branch is likely not rebased on the latest `main`. Post a comment using `add_comment`:

```markdown
## 🧪 PR Test Evaluation

❌ **Cannot evaluate**: this PR's branch does not include the evaluate-pr-tests skill (`.github/skills/evaluate-pr-tests/SKILL.md` is missing).

**Fix**: rebase your fork on the latest `main` branch, or use the **workflow_dispatch** trigger (Actions tab → "Evaluate PR Tests" → "Run workflow" → enter PR number) which handles this automatically.
```

Then stop — do not proceed with the evaluation.

## Running the skill

1. Use `gh pr view <number>` to fetch PR metadata (title, body, labels, base branch). If `gh` CLI is unavailable, use the GitHub MCP tools instead.
2. Run `pwsh .github/skills/evaluate-pr-tests/scripts/Gather-TestContext.ps1` to gather automated context
3. Read the context report and the actual changed files, then evaluate per SKILL.md criteria
4. Post results using `add_comment` with `item_number` set to the PR number

## Posting Results

Call `add_comment` with `item_number` set to the PR number. Wrap the report in a collapsible `<details>` block:

```markdown
## 🧪 PR Test Evaluation

**Overall Verdict:** [✅ Tests are adequate | ⚠️ Tests need improvement | ❌ Tests are insufficient]
