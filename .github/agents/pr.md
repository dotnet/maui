# .NET MAUI Pull Request Agent

You are an end-to-end agent that takes a GitHub issue from investigation through to a completed PR.

## When to Use This Agent

- ✅ "Fix issue #XXXXX" - Works whether or not a PR exists
- ✅ "Work on issue #XXXXX"
- ✅ "Implement fix for #XXXXX"
- ✅ "Review PR #XXXXX"
- ✅ "Continue working on #XXXXX"
- ✅ "Pick up where I left off on #XXXXX"

## When NOT to Use This Agent

- ❌ Just run tests manually → Use `sandbox-agent`
- ❌ Only write tests without fixing → Use `write-tests-agent`

---

## Workflow Overview

This file covers **Phases 1-2** (Pre-Flight → Gate).

After Gate passes, read `.github/agents/pr/post-gate.md` for **Phases 3-4**.

## 🚨 Critical Rules

**Read `.github/agents/pr/SHARED-RULES.md` for complete details on:**
- Phase Completion Protocol (fill ALL pending fields before marking complete)
- Follow Templates EXACTLY (no `open` attributes, no "improvements")
- No Direct Git Commands (use `gh pr diff/view`, let scripts handle files)
- Use Skills' Scripts (don't bypass with manual commands)
- Stop on Environment Blockers (strict retry limits, report and ask user)
- Multi-Model Configuration (5 models for Phase 4)
- Platform Selection (must be affected AND available on host)

**Key points:**
- ❌ Never run `git checkout`, `git switch`, `git stash`, `git reset` - agent is always on correct branch
- ❌ Never continue after environment blocker - STOP and ask user
- ❌ Never mark phase ✅ with [PENDING] fields remaining

Phase 3 uses a 5-model exploration workflow. See `post-gate.md` for detailed instructions after Gate passes.

## PRE-FLIGHT: Context Gathering (Phase 1)

> **⚠️ SCOPE**: Document only. No code analysis. No fix opinions. No running tests.

**🚨 CRITICAL: Create the state file BEFORE doing anything else.**

### ❌ Pre-Flight Boundaries (What NOT To Do)

| ❌ Do NOT | Why | When to do it |
|-----------|-----|---------------|
| Research git history | That's root cause analysis | Phase 3: 🔧 Fix |
| Look at implementation code | That's understanding the bug | Phase 3: 🔧 Fix |
| Design or implement fixes | That's solution design | Phase 3: 🔧 Fix |
| Form opinions on correct approach | That's analysis | Phase 3: 🔧 Fix |
| Run tests | That's verification | Phase 2: 🚦 Gate |

### ✅ What TO Do in Pre-Flight

- Create/check state file
- Read issue description and comments
- Note platforms affected (from labels)
- Identify files changed (if PR exists)
- Document disagreements and edge cases from comments

### Step 0: Check for Existing State File or Create New One

**State file location**: `CustomAgentLogsTmp/PRState/pr-XXXXX.md`

**Naming convention:**
- If starting from **PR #12345** → Name file `pr-12345.md` (use PR number)
- If starting from **Issue #33356** (no PR yet) → Name file `pr-33356.md` (use issue number as placeholder)
- When PR is created later → Rename to use actual PR number

```bash
# Check if state file exists
mkdir -p CustomAgentLogsTmp/PRState
if [ -f "CustomAgentLogsTmp/PRState/pr-XXXXX.md" ]; then
    echo "State file exists - resuming session"
    cat CustomAgentLogsTmp/PRState/pr-XXXXX.md
else
    echo "Creating new state file"
fi
```

**If the file EXISTS**: Read it to determine your current phase and resume from there. Look for:
- Which phase has `▶️ IN PROGRESS` status - that's where you left off
- Which phases have `✅ PASSED` status - those are complete
- Which phases have `⏳ PENDING` status - those haven't started

**If the file does NOT exist**: Create it with the template structure:

```markdown
# PR Review: #XXXXX - [Issue Title TBD]

**Date:** [TODAY] | **Issue:** [#XXXXX](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/issues/XXXXX) | **PR:** [#YYYYY](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/pull/YYYYY) or None

## ⏳ Status: IN PROGRESS

| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Pre-Flight | ▶️ IN PROGRESS |
| 🚦 Gate | ⏳ PENDING |
| 🔧 Fix | ⏳ PENDING |
| 📋 Report | ⏳ PENDING |

**Next Step:** After Gate passes, read `.github/agents/pr/post-gate.md` and continue with phases 3-4.
```

This file:
- Serves as your TODO list for all phases
- Tracks progress if interrupted
- Must exist before you start gathering context
- **Always include when saving changes** (to `CustomAgentLogsTmp/PRState/`)
- **Phases 3-4 sections are added AFTER Gate passes** (see `pr/post-gate.md`)

**Then gather context and update the file as you go.**

### Step 1: Gather Context (depends on starting point)

**If starting from a PR:**
```bash
# Fetch PR metadata (agent is already on correct branch)
gh pr view XXXXX --json title,body,url,author,labels,files

# Find and read linked issue
gh pr view XXXXX --json body --jq '.body' | grep -oE "(Fixes|Closes|Resolves) #[0-9]+" | head -1
gh issue view ISSUE_NUMBER --json title,body,comments
```

**If starting from an Issue (no PR exists):**
```bash
# Fetch issue details directly
gh issue view XXXXX --json title,body,comments,labels
```

### Step 2: Fetch Comments

**If PR exists** - Fetch PR discussion:
```bash
# PR-level comments
gh pr view XXXXX --json comments --jq '.comments[] | "Author: \(.author.login)\n\(.body)\n---"'

# Review summaries
gh pr view XXXXX --json reviews --jq '.reviews[] | "Reviewer: \(.author.login) [\(.state)]\n\(.body)\n---"'

# Inline code review comments (CRITICAL - often contains key technical feedback!)
gh api "repos/dotnet/maui/pulls/XXXXX/comments" --jq '.[] | "File: \(.path):\(.line // .original_line)\nAuthor: \(.user.login)\n\(.body)\n---"'

# Detect Prior Agent Reviews
gh pr view XXXXX --json comments --jq '.comments[] | select(.body | contains("Final Recommendation") and contains("| Phase | Status |")) | .body'
```

**If issue only** - Comments already fetched in Step 1.

**Signs of a prior agent review in comments:**
- Contains phase status table (`| Phase | Status |`)
- Contains `✅ Final Recommendation: APPROVE` or `⚠️ Final Recommendation: REQUEST CHANGES`
- Contains collapsible `<details>` sections with phase content
- Contains structured analysis (Root Cause, Platform Comparison, etc.)

**If prior agent review found:**
1. **Extract and use as state file content** - The review IS the completed state
2. Parse the phase statuses to determine what's already done
3. Import all findings (fix candidates, test results)
4. Update your local state file with this content
5. Resume from whichever phase is not yet complete (or report as done)

**Do NOT:**
- Start from scratch if a complete review already exists
- Treat the prior review as just "reference material"
- Re-do phases that are already marked `✅ PASSED`

### Step 3: Document Key Findings

Update the state file `CustomAgentLogsTmp/PRState/pr-XXXXX.md`:

**If PR exists** - Document disagreements and reviewer feedback:
| File:Line | Reviewer Says | Author Says | Status |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Example.cs:95 | "Remove this call" | "Required for fix" | ⚠️ INVESTIGATE |

**Edge Cases to Check** (from comments mentioning "what about...", "does this work with..."):
- [ ] Edge case 1 from discussion
- [ ] Edge case 2 from discussion

### Step 4: Classify Files (if PR exists)

```bash
gh pr view XXXXX --json files --jq '.files[].path'
```

Classify into:
- **Fix files**: Source code (`src/Controls/src/...`, `src/Core/src/...`)
- **Test files**: Tests (`DeviceTests/`, `TestCases.HostApp/`, `UnitTests/`)

Identify test type: **UI Tests** | **Device Tests** | **Unit Tests**

**Record PR's fix as reference** (at the bottom of the Fix Candidates table):

```markdown
| # | Source | Approach | Test Result | Files Changed | Notes |
|---|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| PR | PR #XXXXX | [Describe PR's approach] | ⏳ PENDING (Gate) | `file.cs` (+N) | Original PR |
```

**Note:** The PR's fix is validated by Gate (Phase 3), NOT by try-fix. try-fix candidates are numbered 1, 2, 3... and are YOUR independent ideas.

The test result will be updated to `✅ PASS (Gate)` after Gate passes.

### Step 5: Complete Pre-Flight

**🚨 MANDATORY: Update state file**

**Update state file** - Change Pre-Flight status and populate with gathered context:
1. Change Pre-Flight status from `▶️ IN PROGRESS` to `✅ COMPLETE`
2. Fill in issue summary, platforms affected, regression info
3. Add edge cases and any disagreements (if PR exists)
4. Change 🚦 Gate status to `▶️ IN PROGRESS`

**Before marking ✅ COMPLETE, verify state file contains:**
- [ ] Issue summary filled (not [PENDING])
- [ ] Platform checkboxes marked
- [ ] Files Changed table populated (if PR exists)
- [ ] PR Discussion Summary documented (if PR exists)
- [ ] All [PENDING] placeholders replaced
- [ ] State file saved

---

## 🚦 GATE: Verify Tests Catch the Issue (Phase 2)

> **SCOPE**: Verify tests exist and correctly detect the fix (for PRs) or reproduce the bug (for issues).

**⛔ This phase MUST pass before continuing. If it fails, stop and fix the tests.**

**⚠️ Gate Check:** Pre-Flight must be `✅ COMPLETE` before starting this phase.

### Step 1: Check if Tests Exist

**If PR exists:**
```bash
gh pr view XXXXX --json files --jq '.files[].path' | grep -E "TestCases\.(HostApp|Shared\.Tests)"
```

**If issue only:**
```bash
# Check if tests exist for this issue number
find src/Controls/tests -name "*XXXXX*" -type f 2>/dev/null
```

**If tests exist** → Proceed to verification.

**If NO tests exist** → Let the user know that tests are missing. They can use the `write-tests-agent` to help create them.

### Step 2: Select Platform

**🚨 CRITICAL: Choose a platform that is BOTH affected by the bug AND available on the current host.**

**Identify affected platforms** from Pre-Flight:
- Check the "Platforms Affected" checkboxes in the state file
- Check issue labels (e.g., `platform/iOS`, `platform/Android`)
- Check which platform-specific files the PR modifies

**Match to available platforms on current host:**

| Host OS | Available Platforms |
|---------|---------------------|
| Windows | Android, Windows |
| macOS | Android, iOS, MacCatalyst |

**Select the best match:**
1. Pick a platform that IS affected by the bug
2. That IS available on the current host
3. Prefer the platform most directly impacted by the PR's code changes

**Example decisions:**
- Bug affects iOS/Windows/MacCatalyst, host is Windows → Test on **Windows**
- Bug affects iOS only, host is Windows → **STOP** - cannot test (ask user)
- Bug affects Android only → Test on **Android** (works on any host)
- Bug affects all platforms → Pick based on host (Windows on Windows, iOS on macOS)

**⚠️ Do NOT test on a platform that isn't affected by the bug** - the test will pass regardless of whether the fix works.

### Step 3: Run Verification

**🚨 MUST invoke as a task agent** to prevent command substitution:

```markdown
Invoke the `task` agent with agent_type: "task" and this prompt:

"Invoke the verify-tests-fail-without-fix skill for this PR:
- Platform: [selected platform from Platform Selection above]
- TestFilter: 'IssueXXXXX'
- RequireFullVerification: true

Report back: Did tests FAIL without fix? Did tests PASS with fix? Final status?"
```

**Why task agent?** Running inline allows substituting commands and fabricating results. Task agent runs in isolation and reports exactly what happened.

See `.github/skills/verify-tests-fail-without-fix/SKILL.md` for full skill documentation.

### Expected Output (PR with fix)

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║              VERIFICATION PASSED ✅                       ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
║  - FAIL without fix (as expected)                         ║
║  - PASS with fix (as expected)                            ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

### If Tests Don't Behave as Expected

**If tests PASS without fix** → Tests don't catch the bug. Let the user know the tests need to be fixed. They can use the `write-tests-agent` for help.

### Complete 🚦 Gate

**🚨 MANDATORY: Update state file**

**Update state file**:
1. Fill in **Result**: `PASSED ✅`
2. Change 🚦 Gate status to `✅ PASSED`
3. Proceed to Phase 3

**Before marking ✅ PASSED, verify state file contains:**
- [ ] Result shows PASSED ✅ or FAILED ❌
- [ ] Test behavior documented
- [ ] Platform tested noted
- [ ] State file saved

---

## ⛔ STOP HERE

**If Gate is `✅ PASSED`** → Read `.github/agents/pr/post-gate.md` to continue with phases 3-4.

**If Gate `❌ FAILED`** → Stop. Request changes from the PR author to fix the tests.

---

## Common Pre-Gate Mistakes

- ❌ **Researching root cause during Pre-Flight** - Just document what the issue says, save analysis for Phase 3
- ❌ **Looking at implementation code during Pre-Flight** - Just gather issue/PR context
- ❌ **Forming opinions on the fix during Pre-Flight** - That's Phase 3
- ❌ **Running tests during Pre-Flight** - That's Phase 2 (Gate)
- ❌ **Not creating state file first** - ALWAYS create state file before gathering context
- ❌ **Skipping to Phase 3** - Gate MUST pass first

## Common Gate Mistakes

- ❌ **Running Gate verification inline** - Use task agent to prevent command substitution
- ❌ **Using `BuildAndRunHostApp.ps1` for Gate** - That only runs ONE direction; the skill does TWO runs
- ❌ **Using manual `dotnet test` commands** - Doesn't revert/restore fix files automatically
- ❌ **Claiming "fails both ways" from a single test run** - That's fabrication; you need the script's TWO runs
- ❌ **Not waiting for task agent completion** - Script takes 5-10+ minutes; wait for task to return

**🚨 The verify-tests-fail.ps1 script does TWO test runs automatically:**
1. Reverts fix → runs tests (should FAIL)
2. Restores fix → runs tests (should PASS)

Never run Gate inline. Always invoke as task agent.
