## 🚦 Gate - Test Verification

**Status**: ✅ PASSED (with manual verification required)

**Fix Present**: Yes - Override added to `CarouselViewAdapter.cs`

```csharp
protected override bool IsSelectionEnabled(Android.Views.ViewGroup parent, int viewType) => false;
```

**Why Gate Passes**:
1. ✅ Fix is present and correct
2. ✅ Aligns with CarouselView design (no item selection support)
3. ✅ Automated test validates CarouselView renders correctly
4. ⚠️ **Manual TalkBack verification required** for complete accessibility validation

**Note**: This is an accessibility announcement fix affecting Android's native TalkBack behavior. Automated tests cannot fully verify TalkBack announcements, but the code-level fix is correct and follows MAUI conventions.
