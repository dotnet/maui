Policy Service Readme
=====================

Policy Service is an automated tool that responds to changes in issues, PRs, or runs on a schedule. It can modify issues and PRs by adding/removing labels, adding comments, or performing other operations.

Those rules are all defined in the associated [policies](/.github/policies) sub-folder. For information about the service and the YAML schema for configuring automation, visit https://eng.ms/docs/more/github-inside-microsoft/policies (Microsoft Internal).
