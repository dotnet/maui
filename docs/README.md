Contributor documentation
=========================

The primary audience for documentation in this folder is contributors to .NET MAUI.

<!--TODO: >> :bulb: If you're a new contributor looking to set up the repo locally, the [build from source documentation](BuildFromSource.md) is the best place to start.-->
