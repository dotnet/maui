### Reproducing an Issue/Debugging .NET MAUI Code
Open the .NET MAUI [workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspaces) in VS Code by simply opening the root of your locally cloned .NET MAUI repository folder. VS Code will detect the workspace automatically and suggest that you open it.

In VS Code, select the device that you will be testing on. Using the Command Palette (<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> or on macOS <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) type `pick device` and you will be presented with a set of choices for your target device (Android, iOS, etc). First select the option that describes the platform you want to run the project on, and then select the device that is available for that platform in the next menu.

There is a sample project in `src/Controls/samples/Controls.Sample.Sandbox`. This is an empty project, which directly references the .NET MAUI code. In this project you can add your code to reproduce an issue while allowing you to set breakpoints in .NET MAUI source code and debug through it easily.

To let VS Code know this is the project you want run, select the Sandbox project by going to the Command Palette (<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> or on macOS <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>) and start typing `pick startup` and select ".NET MAUI: Pick Startup Project" and then select the Sandbox project.

Before using the Command Palette for the first time, you may have to wait a minute
for IntelliSense and other tasks to initialize. If the project hasn't 'settled' yet, you will see an error "Pick Startup Project has resulted in an error."

*Note:* When you are committing your PR, do not include your changes to the Sandbox project.


### Cake Commands

The below parameters can be used with the `dotnet cake` command in the root of your locally cloned .NET MAUI repository folder.

#### Clean
`--clean`
- Occasionally, when switching branches or syncing with the main branch, incremental builds may stop working. A common fix for this is to use git clean -xdf to delete all locally cached build information. However, the issue with git clean -xdf is that it will also wipe out any uncommitted changes. Using --clean to recursively delete the local obj/bin folders should hopefully resolve the issue while preserving your changes.

#### Target a specific platform
`--android`
`--ios`
`--windows`
`--catalyst`

```bash
dotnet cake --target=VS --workloads=global --android --ios
```

*Note* you will have to `git clean -xdf` your project if you change or add platforms. 

### Blazor Hybrid

To build and run Blazor Desktop samples, check out the [Blazor Desktop](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/wiki/Blazor-Desktop) wiki topic.

# Advanced Scenarios

### Compile using a local `bin\dotnet` via `dotnet-local.*`

This method will use the .NET and workload versions that are specific to the branch you are on. There may be occasions when your global installation of .NET is not compatible with a particular branch. In such cases, this method will create a local folder containing all the .NET versions specific to that branch.

Use `dotnet-local.cmd` on Windows or `dotnet-local.sh` on Unix to ensure that `PATH` is set consistently.

#### Cake

You can run a `Cake` target to bootstrap .NET SDK in `bin\dotnet` and launch Visual Studio:

```dotnetcli
dotnet tool restore
dotnet cake --target=VS
```

There is also a `VSCode` target for launching Visual Studio Code.

```dotnetcli
dotnet tool restore
dotnet cake --target=VSCode
```

#### Testing branch against your project
`--sln=<Path to SLN>`
- This will pack .NET and then open a VS instance using the local pack. This is useful if you want to check to see if the changes in a branch will address your particular issues. Pack only runs the first time so you will need to explicitly add the `--pack` flag if you make changes and need to repack.

```dotnetcli
dotnet tool restore
dotnet cake --sln="<download_directory>\MauiApp2\MauiApp2.sln" --target=VS
```

#### Pack
`--pack`
- This creates .NET MAUI packs inside the local dotnet install. This lets you use the CLI commands with the local dotnet to create/deploy with any changes that have been made on that branch (including template changes).

```dotnetcli
dotnet tool restore
dotnet cake --target=VS --pack --sln="<download_directory>\MauiApp2\MauiApp2.sln"
```

Create new .NET MAUI app using your new packs
```dotnetcli
dotnet tool restore
dotnet cake --pack
mkdir MyMauiApp
cd MyMauiApp
..\bin\dotnet\dotnet new maui
..\bin\dotnet\dotnet build -t:Run -f net[current_sdk_version]-android
```

You can also run commands individually:
```dotnetcli
# install local tools required to build (cake, pwsh, etc..)
dotnet tool restore
# Provision .NET SDK in bin\dotnet
dotnet build src\DotNet\DotNet.csproj
# Builds Maui MSBuild tasks
.\bin\dotnet\dotnet build Microsoft.Maui.BuildTasks.slnf
# Builds the rest of Maui
.\bin\dotnet\dotnet build Microsoft.Maui.sln
# Launch Visual Studio
dotnet cake --target=VS
```

## Debugging MSBuild Tasks using VS/VSCode

One thing that is very useful is the ability to debug your Tasks while
they are being run on a build process. This is possible thanks to the
`MSBUILDDEBUGONSTART` environment variable. When set to `2` this will
force MSBuild to wait for a debugger connection before continuing.
You will see the following prompt.


```dotnetcli
Waiting for debugger to attach (dotnet PID 13001).  Press enter to continue...
```

You can then use VS or VSCode to attach to this process and debug you tasks.
You can start your test app with the `dotnet-local` script (so it uses your maui build)

### [MacOS](#tab/macos)

```dotnetcli
MSBUILDDEBUGONSTART=2 ~/<some maui checkout>/dotnet-local.sh build -m:1
```

### [Linux](#tab/linux)

```dotnetcli
MSBUILDDEBUGONSTART=2 ~/<some maui checkout>/dotnet-local.sh build -m:1
```

### [Windows](#tab/windows)

```dotnetcli
set MSBUILDDEBUGONSTART=2
~/<some maui checkout>/dotnet-local.cmd build -m:1
```

---

Note: the `-m:1` is important as it restricts MSBuild to 1 node.

Once MSBuild starts it will print the following

```dotnetcli
Waiting for debugger to attach (dotnet PID xxxx).  Press enter to continue...
```

You need to copy the PID value so we can use this in the IDE. For Visual Studio you can use the `Attach to Process` menu option, while you have the Microsoft.Maui.sln solution open. For VSCode open the workspace then use the `Attach to Process` Run and Debug option. You will be prompted for the PID and it will then connect.

Once connected go back to your command prompt and press ENTER so that the MSBuild process can continue.

You will be able to set breakpoints in Tasks (but not Targets) and step through code from this point on.

If you want to test in-tree in VSCode the `Build Platform Sample` command will ask you if you want to debug MSBuild tasks and fill in the `MSBUILDDEBUGONSTART` for you. The PID text will appear in the `Terminal` window in VSCode. You can then use the `Attach to Process` Run and Debug option to attach to the process.


### Integration Tests

The Integration test project under `src/TestUtils/src/Microsoft.Maui.IntegrationTests` contains tests which build and/or run MAUI templates or other projects.

These tests can be ran using the test explorer in VS, or from command line with `dotnet test`. Here's how to run an individual test with parameters from command line:

```bash
dotnet test src/TestUtils/src/Microsoft.Maui.IntegrationTests --logger "console;verbosity=diagnostic" --filter "Name=Build\(%22maui%22,%22net7.0%22,%22Debug%22,False\)"
```
