UI Testing
===

# Note for New Contributors

We recommend to write a test with Appium, commonly called a UI test. Appium allows for automation to test the app and can be run through the IDE from start to finish like a typical unit test.  For more information, please read about the [types of tests](https://github.com/mattleibow/DeviceRunners/wiki/Types-of-Tests) in the MAUI project.

# Introduction

Currently we are using [Appium](https://appium.io/docs/en/2.0/) to facilitate UI automation for Windows, Catalyst, iOS, and Android.
Appium relies on different implementations called `drivers` for each platform that have different behaviors/functions.
* Windows   - [WinAppDriver](https://github.com/appium/appium-windows-driver)
* Catalyst  - [mac2](https://github.com/appium/appium-mac2-driver)
* iOS       - [XCUITest](https://github.com/appium/appium-xcuitest-driver)
* Android   - [UIAutomator2](https://github.com/appium/appium-uiautomator2-driver)


## Creating a new test

### Adding a new Issue

This will be the majority of new tests added which will be primarily for testing functionality and adding regression tests.

## Adding a Reproduction to the Test App

You will need to create some kind of UI to test against, which will go in the Controls.TestCases.HostApp project. This will be an actual MAUI app under test and has no dependency on Appium. Create a new class within `src/Controls/tests/TestCases.HostApp/Issues` and attribute it with `[Issue]`. Create it like any normal page you would make in app to reproduce the issue. This could be just in XAML or just code, along with a screenshot.

## Adding a Test to Interact with the Reproduction

Next you will need to create the appium test in the `Controls.TestCases.Shared.Tests` project, which is a library project that runs NUnit tests via Appium. Add a new class with the same name as the Reproduction within this folder: `src/Controls/tests/TestCases.Shared.Tests/Tests/Issues`. Have the class derive from `_IssuesUITest` and add your test(s) as methods.

## Link them together with the Issue String

An important component that you need in order for Appium to run your test is to add a string with a text description of your class. In the class defined in the HostApp project, add an Issue attribute above the class signature. For example:
`[Issue(IssueTracker.Github, 2680, "Add VerticalScrollMode/HorizontalScrollMode to ListView and ScrollView", PlatformAffected.All)]`

Then in the class defined in the TestsCases project, assign the string to a property called `Issue` as so:
`public override string Issue => "Add VerticalScrollMode/HorizontalScrollMode to ListView and ScrollView";`

It is <b>imperative</b> that both strings are identical, as Appium will use the `Issue` string in the search box of the app to find the Issue as it is defined by its attribute.

You can use the example for the sample project: here is the  [xaml](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/pull/24165/files#diff-6bbe6730a6964c64dc513d2b6f9fa207f65518dec40077c3d217394fcb7f09fbR36) and the [xaml.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/blob/443afb7d07cdd42e9b0091b17d00f76d92b3c3b7/src/Controls/tests/TestCases.HostApp/Issues/Issue11969.xaml.cs) and the example for the corresponding test [here](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/blob/443afb7d07cdd42e9b0091b17d00f76d92b3c3b7/src/Controls/tests/TestCases.Shared.Tests/Tests/Issues/Issue11969.cs).

### Interacting with Elements in Tests

 All controls you intend to interact with need to set the `AutomationId` property as this will be what you use to query for the element. You can either set it in the xaml as an attribute when you create the element or you can assign it when you create the element in the `*.cs` file.

Note: AutomationId will not work on layouts on Windows. This is because Appium uses the accessibility tree to locate elements, and layouts are not visible in the accessibility tree. You will have to focus on the individual elements such as label, entry, editor, and so on.

### Example

The test will have access to gestures/interactions through the `App` property.
```csharp
App.WaitForElement("btnLogin");
App.EnterText("entryUsername", "user@email.com");
App.EnterText("entryPassword", "Password");

App.Tap("btnLogin");
var lblStatus = App.WaitForElement("lblStatus").FirstOrDefault();
var text = lblStatus?.Text;

Assert.IsNotNull(text);
Assert.IsTrue(text.StartsWith("Logging in", StringComparison.CurrentCulture));
```

### Screenshots

Testing against a previously saved screenshot of the simulator can be an important asset when it comes to writing tests. Currently, this is how you can do so when using the CI:
1. Call `VerifyScreenshot()` at the end of your test method.
2) Start a pull request, and have it run on the CI.
3) Navigate to the bottom of the request where there is a list of the various checks on the CI. Scroll down until you see `Maui-UITestpublic` (will have a required bubble next to it) and and click Details.![Details](../assets/VerifyScreenshotsPart1.png)
 Scroll down the page until you see "View More Details on Azure Pipelines" ![More Details](../assets/VerifyScreenshotsPart2.png).
 
    At the top of the summary page, you should see a box with Repositories, Time Started and Elapsed, Related, and Tests and Coverage.![Top Of Page](../assets/VerifyScreenshotsPart3.png) Click on the "Consumed" link below the "Related" heading. ![Artifacts](../assets/VerifyScreenshotsPart4.png) 
 
    Click on the three dots to the right of "Drop" to download it. ![Drop](../assets/VerifyScreenshotsPart5.png)
4) When you unzip the archive, navigate to the `Controls.TestCases.Shared` folder which will have the snapshot. NOTE: in future testing, if this test will have failed, the snapshot will have a -diff attached to its filename, with red outlining to indicate problem areas.
5) Add the snapshot .png to your test. Each platform has its own TestCases project will have a snapshots folder within it to add your .png. ![Drop](../assets/VerifyScreenshotsPart5.png) Please ensure that the file has the same name as the TestMethod that will call `VerifyScreenshots()`. Note: TestCases.IOS.Tests has two sub-folders within its `snapshots` folder, `ios` and `ios-iphonex`. You only have to submit your screenshot to the ios folder.
6) Commit the change to your PR.

Once everything is committed, you will be able to see screenshots produced by CI whenever you access failed tests:
![Pic of CI](../assets/FailedTestScreenshot.png)

## Adding a GalleryPage

Gallery tests are to make it easier to run the same set of tests on controls, if you are creating a new control you would want to add a new gallery page.

We have some base classes you can derive from to make setting this up easier: [CoreGalleryPage](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/blob/main/src/Controls/tests/TestCases.HostApp/CoreViews/CoreGalleryPage.cs) and [ContentViewGalleryPage](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/blob/main/src/Controls/tests/TestCases.HostApp/Elements/ContentViewGalleryPage.cs)

### Restarting the App after a Test

- When multiple tests are run, all methods under one class will be tested in the same instance of the app. The app will then restart as it changes to the next test class. If you would like the app to be be restarted after method in the class, add this override property to your class:
```csharp
protected override bool ResetAfterEachTest => true;
```

### Handling different operating systems

There may be times when you want to have the test run on some platforms and not others. For example, `VerifyScreenshot()` does not currently work on MacCatalyst. In this case, you would want to use preprocessor directives:

```csharp
#if ! MACCATALYST
//your code here
#endif
```

When you compile `Controls.TestCases.Mac.Tests`, the test will not appear in the list of tests. 

## Building and Running tests
Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/wiki/UITests) for setting up/running tests.

## Logging

Follow the steps above for accessing Screenshots to access the logs from the drop folder. All platforms will have a log produced by Appium with the name `appium_<platform_name>.log` that can be consulted for Appium output.

IOS - `logarchive` files from the console output of the simulator (currently there might be logarchives from other simulators so be sure to validate that there are logs from your test run in the log archive).
 
Android - If a test fails or the device crashes, there will be a `logcat` file in this folder that you can look at for information.

Windows & Mac - Log output for these platforms are currently only available in [Device Tests](https://github.com/dotnet/maui/wiki/DeviceTests).

## Known Issues
- iOS doesn't support nested accessibility elements which will make some elements unreachable
