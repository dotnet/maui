distance, Mount Fuji presents a beautiful, nearly symmetric, often snow-capped 
profile and is Japan’s tallest and most iconic mountain. The volcanic cone rises 
gracefully up to slightly more than 12,000 feet. On clear days, the mountain is 
visible as far away as Tokyo. Despite its seemingly peaceful distant existence, 
Mount Fuji is an active volcano. Its last eruption was in 1707."}
