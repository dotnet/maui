    <!-- Required for unpackaged Windows deployment on Helix - bundle Windows App SDK alongside the EXE.
         Only applies to unpackaged builds (signaled by _MauiDeviceTestUnpackaged=true from Cake script).
         Packaged (MSIX) builds must NOT set this, as it prevents MSIX generation.
         NOTE: This file is imported directly from each device test csproj, NOT via Directory.Build.props,
         because adding Directory.Build.props to these folders breaks AppxPackageDir via Arcade SDK. -->
