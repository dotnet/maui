This folder can contain all the Windows-specific images that your app may use.

The images in the `Images` sub folder are easily accessible in cross-platform
code because they are packaged in the root of the application making them
have a similar path to the other platforms.

For example, if there is a file:

    /Assets/Images/my_image.png

This can be accessed with the same code as the other platforms in shared code:

    <Image Source="my_image.png" />
