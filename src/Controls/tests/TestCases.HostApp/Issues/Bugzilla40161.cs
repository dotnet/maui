	// If an image is swapped out for another image must the size of an image be recomputed? 
	// That would work but is slow. As an optimization, if an image's size is controlled by 
	// it's parents and the parents dictate that any image will be a specific size then there
	// is no need to layout the image. Consider the following scenarios:

	// (a) An absolute layout dictates the size of a child image when the child specifies that it
	// should fill the space allocated by the aboslute layout. In this case the optimization 
	// should be enabled; the layout pass for the replaced image can be skipped. The replaced image
	// should occupy the same space as the orig image.

	// (b) The image size is *not* dicatated by the absolute layout if it chooses not to fill the 
	// space the absolute layout  allocates it and instead chooses to simply be centered with in 
	// that space. In this case the layout pass for the replaced image must be run to compute the 
	// size of the replaced image. This was the case reported by the bug that led to this UITest.

			// The size of an AbsoluteLayout whose H/V options equal Fill will match its

			// such an AbsoluteLayout by not recomputing its size if its parent container 
			// does not change size. Such an AbsoluteLayout is marked as special by setting
			// its AbsoluteLayout.LayoutConstraint to fixed. All it's children will inherit

			// the layout and so it's size should be re-computed iff the layout's size has
			// changed. This behavior is achived by inheriting the layout's LayoutConstraint.
